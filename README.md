### Abstract
This paper proposes a novel approach that integrates small language models (SLMs) with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to deliver precise and comprehensible medical information. Our method retrieves relevant evidence from external medical knowledge (e.g., PubMed and clinical guidelines), converting them into vector embeddings to enable high-fidelity semantic retrieval. An SLM is then employed to synthesize the retrieved evidence into fluent, context-aware responses. Extensive experiments conducted on the PubMedQA benchmark dataset demonstrate that the proposed method not only enhances answer accuracy, but also improves computational efficiency compared to larger language models. Additionally, the approach supports seamless domain knowledge updates without requiring extensive retraining.
